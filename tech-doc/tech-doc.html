        <p> Due to the strict health concerns of French Bulldogs, their diets have to often be restricted.</p>

          Although they can eat regular dog food, they should be kept away from human food.

          <h2>Health</h2>
          </header>
          <p>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important for French Bulldogs. Due to their natural shape and build, a calm lifestyle can create big health problems.</p>
          <p>Although a healthy lifestyle is important for the life of a French Bulldog, it is also important to keep watch on the activity of a French Bulldog. Many Frenchies struggle with breathing due to their face shape, so overexertion is common. As well, due to the shape of their spines, they often can be injured by being too active.</p>

        <p>Although it is true that French Bulldogs enjoy spending time with their owners, they like to do it on their own terms.</p>
